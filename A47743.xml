            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Subject of <hi>Tythes</hi> is the <hi>Great DIANA</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi> They have Bent their Whole <hi>Force</hi> againſt <hi>Tythe,</hi> as the likelieſt Means to overthrow the <hi>Church.</hi> And herein they have Many <hi>Abettors.</hi> Upon whoſe Account, I Reſolv'd to Conſider of <hi>Tythe,</hi> in a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>My Controverſie with the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> has led me into Subjects of Different Natures, and Engag'd me among other <hi>Parties.</hi> As when they began to be Convinced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Neceſſity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>The Lord's Supper:</hi> But ſtuck upon the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> to whom they ſhould go for it: To ſatisfie them in this, forc'd me Directly upon the Cauſe of
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:63938:3"/>
               <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> This concerned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> And received a very Angry <hi>Anſwer</hi> from one who Stiles himſelf a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> Wherein I cou'd find Nothing to <hi>Reply</hi> to but <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Perſonal Reflections,</hi> therefor I let it Sleep.</p>
            <p>The like Fate I may meet with in this, That it will be Oppos'd by others than the <hi>Quakers.</hi> And indeed it is for the ſake of others more than the <hi>Quakers</hi> that I write it. Of others who ſhou'd have more underſtanding, as not being Carry'd away with that Blind <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> which Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But yet who ſuffer themſelves to Swim down the Stream of a <hi>Popular Sacrilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ther is nothing needful to theſe Men but to Rouſe a little, to open their Eyes, and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And not to follow a <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to do <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:63938:3"/>
            <p>I have not in the following Sheets quoted any of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Books,</hi> or Repeated their poor <hi>Arguments,</hi> which they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pickt up and down the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Common Objections that were then Running about, and you will meet with every where; they are all <hi>Anſwer'd,</hi> tho not <hi>Nam'd</hi> in what follows.</p>
            <p>But it is very obſervable, to what an Exceſs of <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> againſt all the <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which Poſſeſs'd the <hi>Quakers</hi> did Hurry them. Even to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this Part of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Offering</hi> of His <hi>Tythe,</hi> to be a <hi>Renouncing</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> a <hi>Denial</hi> of his having come in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and a <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> As you may ſee in <hi>The Snake in the Graſs</hi> Sect. XIX.
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:63938:4"/>And there ſufficiently Anſwer'd. Together with their other <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns</hi> they had in their <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to <hi>Tythes,</hi> on Purpoſe to <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Deſtroy</hi> the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefor leaving theſe Men, I turn to More Conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. And firſt I Name <hi>Milton,</hi> only for his <hi>Name,</hi> leſt the <hi>Party</hi> ſhould ſay, That I had not Conſider'd his Performance againſt <hi>Tythes.</hi> Which has More <hi>Wit,</hi> but little more <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> than the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Fancy</hi> was too Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for his <hi>Judgment.</hi> His Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lay ſo much in <hi>Satyr</hi> that he hated <hi>Reaſoning.</hi> Or rather, he got not leave to make uſe of it, while he wrote for <hi>Hire</hi> againſt his own Opinion. Which Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what he wrote <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbrib'd</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> has not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed)
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:63938:4"/>contrary to what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards had a <hi>Penſion</hi> to ſet up. He ſacrific'd a Noble <hi>Genius</hi> to the <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>Age.</hi> He has thrown away ſome of his <hi>Railery</hi> againſt <hi>Tythes,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> then underfoot. Which Tickl'd little <hi>Toland</hi> to that Degree, That tho he has <hi>Reprinted</hi> that Precious Piece againſt <hi>Tythe</hi> call'd <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations touching the likelieſt Means to Remove HIRELINGS, &amp;c.</hi> among the Reſt of <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>SHAME,</hi> yet he has thruſt <hi>Platches</hi> of it into that <hi>Life</hi> he wrote of <hi>Milton,</hi> the moſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable</hi> (we muſt ſuppoſe) that he cou'd find, to be Worth this <hi>Repetition,</hi> as <hi>A Pulpit Divine,</hi> a <hi>LOLLARD indeed over his EL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOW-C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SHION. And his Sheep ſit— as the Sheep in their PEWS at SMITHFIELD.</hi> And ſuch
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:63938:5"/>like <hi>Contemptible WITTICISMS, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy</hi> an <hi>Author</hi> of any <hi>Name.</hi> And ſhew Mr. <hi>Toland</hi>'s Judgment in Picking out theſe, to <hi>Adorn</hi> his <hi>Life,</hi> leſt the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> might have <hi>Over-look'd</hi> ſuch <hi>Delicious Stroaks,</hi> in the Peruſal of his <hi>Works!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Men of <hi>Senſe,</hi> it ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lik Playing of <hi>Booty,</hi> to Pleaſe thoſe <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Knaves</hi> who <hi>Hir'd</hi> him to write againſt <hi>Hirelings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing elſe cou'd have made him <hi>Submit</hi> to ſet down (what he muſt know to be <hi>Falſe,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have a very Mean Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his <hi>Knowledge</hi>) the Cry of the <hi>Ignorant Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKERS,</hi> That we made Uſe of The <hi>PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISH Arguments againſt Tythes</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> likewiſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints</hi> in the <hi>Quotations</hi> he <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats</hi> in his <hi>Life</hi>) Whereas all
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:63938:5"/>that have any skill in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do know, That the <hi>Popiſh Writers</hi> were the <hi>First</hi> and Great <hi>Corrupters</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tythe</hi> (As is told <hi>Pag.</hi> 128, 129.) And that the <hi>Oppoſers,</hi> and not the <hi>Defenders</hi> of <hi>Tythe</hi> have borrow'd their <hi>Arguments.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> knew what wou'd <hi>Pleaſe;</hi> he Regarded not the <hi>Truth,</hi> but the <hi>Hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And knowing this, he was Reſolv'd to Cry <hi>Whore</hi> firſt. Therefor he Charg'd the <hi>Clergy</hi> with the Name of <hi>Hirelings.</hi> Which if it be Meant of thoſe who take any thing for their <hi>Preaching,</hi> it flies Directly in the face of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> who uſes the ſame word concerning <hi>Preachers,</hi> ſaying that <hi>The Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is worthy of his Hire,</hi> Luk. x. 7. But if it be Meant (as it can
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:63938:6"/>bear no other Meaning) That they are the Culpable <hi>Hirelings</hi> who value the <hi>Hire</hi> more than the <hi>Work:</hi> That is to be known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Him who knows the <hi>Heart.</hi> And can be <hi>Guest</hi> at by us, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Conſequences.</p>
            <p>And for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching <hi>Gratis</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which is urg'd by the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> it makes againſt them; for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Aſſerts his Right to <hi>have been Burthenſome as the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</hi> 1 Theſſ. ii. 6. And ſays, <hi>I have Robbed other Churches taking Wages of them, to do you Service,</hi> 2 Cor xi. 8. And he gives the Reaſon <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>To cut off occaſion from them that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire occaſion</hi> — <hi>Such are Falſe Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. who had Rais'd a Great <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:63938:6"/>
               <hi>Corinth,</hi> Alledging that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> ſought their own <hi>Gain</hi> by their <hi>Preaching:</hi> And Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to Make <hi>Diſciples</hi> to <hi>themſelves</hi> rather than to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For which Cauſe he ſays he was glad that he had <hi>Baptized</hi> ſo few in <hi>Corinth</hi> (Whence the <hi>Quakers</hi> Argue againſt <hi>Baptiſm</hi> too). <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>any ſhou'd ſay, that I had Baptized in mine own Name.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 15. And asks them <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Were ye Baptiſed in the Name of Paul?</hi> For the ſame Reaſon he wou'd take no <hi>Wages</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to ſtop the Mouths of theſe <hi>Schiſmatical Apoſtles.</hi> And ſays, he <hi>Boaſts</hi> in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 10. But where had been the Cauſe of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> if he had only Refus'd to Exact what was None of his Due? He ſtands upon it to be his Due: And ſays,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:63938:7"/>
               <hi>So hath the Lord Ordained, that they who Preach the Goſpel, ſhou'd Live of the Goſpel.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 14. But ſays he, <hi>I have uſed none of theſe things,</hi> that is, Amongſt you. And therein he <hi>Glories.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Tho I Preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to Glory of, for Neceſſity is laid upon Me, Yea Woe is unto Me if I Preach not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> But ther was no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> laid upon him to Abate of his Right, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had given to all his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> of taking <hi>Wages</hi> or a <hi>Maintenance</hi> from the People to whom they <hi>Preach.</hi> And he Abating of that, for Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Conſiderations, at that time, is far from a Precedent to all other <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places.</hi> For the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us that the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not ſo, and that he did otherwiſe, at other <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:63938:7"/>
            <p>If theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> and others who Rail at <hi>Hirelings</hi> wou'd I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; And take Nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their <hi>Preaching,</hi> while they (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) Aſſert the Right of Others to it, they might have ſome Pretence.</p>

Fox</hi> from a <hi>Poor Journey-Man</hi> to a <hi>Shoemaker</hi> in <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> from his <hi>Leathern-Briches,</hi> and going on <hi>Foot,</hi> and often <hi>Bare-foot,</hi> Mount, by his <hi>Preaching-Trade,</hi> on <hi>Horſe-back,</hi> with his Man carrying his <hi>Cloak</hi> before him, to Act the <hi>Gentle-Man,</hi> And leave 1000 <hi>l.</hi> behind him for Printing of his Books, which cry out againſt <hi>Hirelings!</hi> and ſay, <hi>Freely ye have Received, freely Give!</hi> And when we ſee a Man of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Wit <hi>Chime</hi> in with ſuch a <hi>Herd,</hi>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:63938:8"/>and Help on the <hi>Cry</hi> againſt <hi>Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings!</hi> We find How Eaſie it is for <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Knavery</hi> to Meet, and that they are Near of Kin, tho they bear Different <hi>Aſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefor ſince <hi>Milton</hi> has put himſelf upon a <hi>Level</hi> with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this, I will let them go together. And take as little Notice of his <hi>Buffoonry,</hi> as of their <hi>Dulneſs</hi> againſt <hi>Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ther is nothing worth <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> in his <hi>Lampoon</hi> againſt the <hi>Hirelings.</hi> But what ther is of <hi>Argument</hi> in it, is fully Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in what follows.</p>
            <p>But ther is another who has gone about his buſineſs more like a Work-Man, and Attack'd <hi>Tythes,</hi> with great <hi>Subtilty</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> it is the Famous Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in what he calls <hi>The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:63938:8"/>of Tythes.</hi> And pretends that it is Nothing elſe but a plain <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> without any Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Divine Right</hi> or any other <hi>Settlement</hi> of <hi>Tythes.</hi> But then he Carries on his <hi>Mine</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground, and gives ſuch <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts</hi> of them, as wou'd Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally overthrow them.</p>
            <p>Therefor I have Conſider'd this Book of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s with more Care, as ſuppoſing it to Contain the Utmoſt that can be <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>Inſinuated</hi> againſt the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether I have done him Juſtice, or not, Let the Reader Judge.</p>
            <p>I have one thing More to <hi>Advertiſe</hi> in this Place. By what is ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 138. it may be thought as if I were of Opinion, that
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:63938:9"/>
               <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> had neither <hi>Vowed</hi> nor <hi>Promiſed</hi> the <hi>Price</hi> of their <hi>Lands.</hi> Though ther is a <hi>Caution</hi> put againſt this (if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) in the Wording of it, as it is ſaid, <hi>they had not FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MALLY Vowed, or Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Nor is that Averr'd Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as follows, <hi>for ought Appears,</hi> i. e. in the <hi>Text,</hi> where it is not ſo <hi>Expreſly</hi> ſaid. But I think it is <hi>Implied.</hi> For it is Plain by their <hi>Anſwers,</hi> that they ſold their Lands, under the <hi>Pretence</hi> of Giving the <hi>Whole Price,</hi> as others did. How <hi>FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MALLY</hi> they had before <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi> or <hi>Vowed</hi> this, is not ſaid in the <hi>Text.</hi> Nor was ther need of it, for ſuppoſing, as I do in the place above Quoted, That they had only <hi>Reſolv'd</hi> it in the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of their own <hi>Mind,</hi> it
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:63938:9"/>was <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> after that, to <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> from what was ſo <hi>Deſign'd</hi> and, by that, <hi>Dedicated</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> though none <hi>Knew</hi> it but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefor I took this way, to Obviate the <hi>Cavils</hi> that might be Rais'd Concerning the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> of their <hi>Vow,</hi> or <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this <hi>Money;</hi> which we are Requir'd to <hi>Shew</hi> and <hi>Produce</hi> out of the <hi>Text.</hi> Nothing leſs will ſerve <hi>Some</hi> Men, upon <hi>Some</hi> Points! Though they will be very Loath to be Ty'd to it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>For Example; That the <hi>Sin</hi> for which <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was ſo <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi> and <hi>Miraculouſly</hi> Puniſhed, was <hi>Exceſs</hi> in <hi>Drinking,</hi> of which ther is not one Word in the <hi>Text.</hi> But the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> is there Plainly ſet down.
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:63938:10"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Profaning</hi> the <hi>Holy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> Yet in the <hi>Aſſemblies Annotations</hi> (An. 1646.) upon <hi>Dan.</hi> v. 2. They cou'd find no <hi>Sacrilege</hi> in this.</p>
            <p>No, Nor in the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſh. vi. 17, 18, 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. This was put upon <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Though the <hi>Text</hi> ſays Plainly that it was for taking of what was <hi>Accurſed,</hi> that is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted</hi> and <hi>Conſecrated</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and therefor <hi>Accurſed</hi> to any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhou'd <hi>Invade</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Neither cou'd they find any <hi>Sacrilege</hi> in the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Ananias;</hi> only <hi>Covetuouſneſs</hi> there too, and <hi>Vanity, Lying,</hi> or any thing but <hi>Sacrilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Inſtances, of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> in the Beginning of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> and of <hi>Ananias</hi> in the Beginning of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:63938:10"/>are ſet in the <hi>Front,</hi> That <hi>All</hi> Might take Notice of <hi>God</hi>'s High <hi>Indignation</hi> againſt this <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Sacrilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is to be Notic'd too, how <hi>Cloſe</hi> Men that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd can <hi>Shut</hi> their <hi>Eyes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ther is not only no <hi>Sacrilege</hi> in theſe <hi>Inſtances!</hi> But ther is not <hi>Now</hi> any ſuch <hi>Sin</hi> as <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege!</hi> Or <hi>Some</hi> Men are not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of <hi>Committing</hi> it! A poor <hi>Rogue</hi> may be <hi>Whipt</hi> for <hi>Stealing</hi> a <hi>Cuſhion</hi> or an <hi>Hour-Glaſs</hi> out of a <hi>Church,</hi> rather for <hi>Example</hi> ſake, than that ther is any Great Matter in it, beſides the Humor of <hi>Pilfering,</hi> which, in time, may lead them into our <hi>Houſes!</hi> But ther are others, who can <hi>Seize</hi> upon <hi>CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCHES,</hi> and Convert them to <hi>COMMON</hi> uſe. And yet, None Dare call
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:63938:11"/>it <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> or Any <hi>Fault</hi> at all. For it is <hi>None,</hi> if it be not <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege.</hi> And I wou'd gladly be Inform'd, What that <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege</hi> is, if this be not it?</p>
            <p>I can ſee no <hi>Remedy,</hi> but that we Muſt even <hi>Drop</hi> this <hi>Sin,</hi> as to ſome Particular <hi>Perſons, Times,</hi> and <hi>Places.</hi> And the More <hi>Sins</hi> we <hi>Drop,</hi> we leave the <hi>Leſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind!

               <p>ST. <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the <hi>Schiſm</hi> which had Unhappily broken out in their <hi>Church,</hi> ſpent moſt of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to them in Guarding them againſt the Sins of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had done in both his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to them; knowing that theſe were the <hi>Roots</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63938:14"/>whence their <hi>Schiſm</hi> grew, and All <hi>Schiſms</hi> do Grow.

               </p>
               <p>This is the Method I have Choſe, in the Subject I have Undertaken: To make my Entrance with ſome Conſiderations concerning that <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Dependence</hi> which we ought to have in <hi>God:</hi> The Want of which is the <hi>Root</hi> of all <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> which is therefore call'd <hi>Idolatry,</hi> becauſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>

               <p n="1">I.<note place="margin">Exod. xxiv. 23, 24.</note>Thus <hi>Three</hi> Times every Year all the <hi>Men</hi> in the whole Nation were Commanded to leave all their <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> Unguarded, and to come up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to attend the ſolemn <hi>Feaſts</hi> there. Here the Objection riſes Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, That they being often, almoſt always in War with all their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nations; And theſe Nations knowing the Times of theſe their <hi>Feaſts,</hi> when all their Country was left Deſtitute of <hi>Men,</hi> except <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> whither they <hi>All</hi> went, their Enemies ſhou'd watch theſe Times, and make Inroads upon the Country, which no Men were left to Defend.</p>
               <p>But, for a Security from this, God Commands them to Depend wholly upon His Promiſe, (<hi>v.</hi> 24. above-quoted,) in theſe Words, <hi>Neither ſhall any Man Deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God, thrice in the Year.</hi> Here God not only Promiſes that none ſhall <hi>Invade</hi> their Land, but that no Man ſhould ſo much as <hi>Deſire</hi> it, at thoſe Times, though all the reſt of the Year they were at open Wars with them.</p>

               <p>And purſuant to this Promiſe, it is miraculouſly obſervable in their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, that they were never invaded, in any of theſe Times, while they Perform'd this Command.</p>

Behold we ſhall not ſow, nor gather in our Increaſe.</hi> And the Anſwer is given in the next Verſes; <hi>Then I will Command my Bleſſing upon you in the Sixth Year, and it ſhall bring forth Fruit for Three Years; and ye ſhall ſow the Eighth Year, and Eat yet of old Fruit, until the Ninth Year; until her Fruits come in, ye ſhall Eat of the old Store.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this they were to Truſt their very <hi>Lives,</hi> they were to <hi>Starve</hi> if it fail'd.</p>
               <p>But if they ſhou'd Truſt entirely to theſe Promiſes of God, then God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them of His Bleſſing for it, (<hi>v.</hi> 18, and 19.) both to Protect their Land from their Enemies, and to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63938:18"/>Feed them to the full in it: <hi>Wherefore ye ſhall do my Statutes, and keep my Judgments, and do them; and ye ſhall Dwell in the Land in Safety: And the Land ſhall yield her Fruit, and ye ſhall Eat your fill, and Dwell therein in Safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, on the other hand, if they wou'd not Truſt abſolutely to God, then God threatens them that the Second Cauſes ſhall not help them, wherein they Truſted; But that He can Command all the Courſes of Nature, and to their Puniſhment, if they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, as well as to their Benefit, if they Truſt in God.</p>
               <p>If they ſhou'd <hi>Refuſe</hi> or <hi>Neglect</hi> to keep the <hi>Sabbatical Year,</hi> then God threatens them that He wou'd Baniſh them out of the Land, and that the Land ſhou'd enjoy her <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> that is, <hi>Rest</hi> from being <hi>Plow'd</hi> or <hi>Sow'd,</hi> when they were out of it, ſince they Durſt not Truſt ſo far in God, as to let her have that <hi>Rest</hi> He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while they were in it.

                  <hi>Then ſhall the Land Enjoy her Sabbaths, as long as it lieth Deſolate, and ye be in your Enemy's

               </p>
               <p>Now it is very obſervable how Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly this <hi>Threatning</hi> (or <hi>Prophecy</hi>) was fulfill'd upon the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this Pretence is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by what is ſaid in the vij <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> above <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram,</hi> from <hi>Abram</hi>'s Paying of <hi>Tythes</hi> to him. <hi>Now Conſider</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>how Great this Man was, unto whom even the Patriarch</hi> Abram <hi>gave the Tenth of the Spoils.</hi> But if it had been only a <hi>Gratuity</hi> or <hi>Free Gift</hi> from <hi>Abram,</hi> it wou'd have argu'd the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of <hi>Abram</hi> above <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec;</hi> for the <hi>Giver</hi> is <hi>Greater</hi> than the <hi>Receiver.</hi>

               <p>Again, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues the <hi>Preference</hi> of the <hi>Melchiſedecal</hi> Prieſthood before that of <hi>Levi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Levi,</hi> in his Father <hi>Abram,</hi> paid <hi>Tythes</hi> to <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are called <hi>The First of the First-frruts,</hi> Exod. xxxiv. 26.

And yet <hi>Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolemus</hi> is not ſaid to have been the firſt who brought the Notion of <hi>Tythes</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> only that he made Laws for it, in his own Country, which ſuppoſes the thing to be known before.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> wou'd ſcrew it in another way, and (as I before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

But if one of theſe muſt learn it from the other, it is more Probable that <hi>Abram</hi> might learn'd from <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> than <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> from <hi>Abram:</hi> for <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was much the Elder Man; and both a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Priest.</hi> But the Truth is neither of them did learn it from the other; Both knew it, and learn'd it from their Fathers. And that Inſtance

               <p>And <hi>Judgments</hi> might Attend it.

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> muſt <hi>Sin</hi> herein more <hi>Willfully</hi> than the <hi>Heathen,</hi> becauſe he had more Knowledge than they, that this <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> was <hi>Forbidden</hi> by <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>For this <hi>Reaſon Joſeph</hi> did not Buy the <hi>Lands</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> (Gen. xlvij. 22.) becauſe they were Given to a <hi>Religious</hi> tho <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Uſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons, the <hi>Heathens</hi> may be Allowd among the Inſtances of God's <hi>Judgments</hi> upon <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> particularly that Branch of it, which is our preſent Subject, the <hi>Subtraction</hi> of <hi>Tythe.</hi> However it confirms their opinion concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Tythes:</hi> for otherwiſe they cou'd not have thought that the <hi>Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> fell upon them for their <hi>Subtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of their <hi>Tythe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe I lay the leaſt Streſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Inſtances from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> I will only Name a <hi>Few,</hi> that I might not wholly omit them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is told before in the Story of <hi>Camillus</hi> how the <hi>Romans</hi> Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Diſpleaſure of the <hi>Gods,</hi> And what Reparation they Made for the <hi>Soldiers</hi> not giving the <hi>Tenth</hi> of the <hi>Booty</hi> they got in the <hi>Sacking</hi> of <hi>Veies.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:63938:95"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Heſiod</hi> (as before mentioned) tells of the People <hi>Thoes,</hi> who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Atheiſtical,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they paid not their <hi>Tythes</hi> to the <hi>Gods:</hi> and that they were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſtroy'd by the <hi>Gods;</hi> for that Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Diodor.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Pauſan. Hiſt. Graec.</hi> ſays that the <hi>Siphnians,</hi> who us'd to pay the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Tythe</hi> of their <hi>Mines,</hi> Loſt them, by the Juſtice of the Gods, for having Omitted that Payment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And, to name no more, <hi>Dioniſ. Halicar.</hi> l. 1. ſhews how the <hi>Pelaſgi</hi> in <hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63938:96"/>
                  <hi>Gods,</hi> that Judgment was Remov'd.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient (at leaſt) to ſhew the Notion of the <hi>Heathen</hi> in this Point.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But it is more Authentick to ſee how <hi>God</hi> Puniſhed this Neglect of <hi>Tythe,</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And we find this to have born a Great Part in the moſt Remarkable <hi>Judgments</hi> that befel them. 1. The <hi>Captivity</hi> of the 10 <hi>Tribes</hi> was in the Reign of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> And we find by the <hi>Reformation</hi> which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>r that, as well in <hi>Iſrael</hi> as <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> xxxi. that the Payment of their <hi>Tythes</hi> had been Greatly Neglected; the Reſtoring of the <hi>Tythe</hi> being a Main Branch of that <hi>Reformation.</hi> And therefor ther is no Doubt but that the Neglect of paying their <hi>Tythe</hi> had a Main weight, as in the <hi>Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the <hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> which ſoon after followed.</p>
               <p>This farther appears in the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> after the <hi>Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Wherein they Promiſed Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe things which they had formerly Neglected; and for which <hi>Neglect</hi> that <hi>Captivity</hi> was ſent upon
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63938:96"/>them. They particularly Remember the Neglect of the <hi>Sabbatical year,</hi> and the year of <hi>Releaſe</hi> (before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) and Promiſe the future obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them. <hi>Neh.</hi> x. 31. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the end of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> ther is Large Mention, and Renewed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as to the Due and Exact pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Tythes;</hi> which makes it plain, that as the <hi>Sabbatical year</hi> and the year of <hi>Releaſe,</hi> ſo the <hi>Tythes</hi> had been Neglected; and that for ſuch Neglect, they had been Puniſhed with that <hi>Long Captivity.</hi> And as the Land had Reſt for 70 years together, to fulfil ſo many <hi>Sabbatical years</hi> as they had Neglected (which is ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Sect.</hi> i. pag. 11.) So were they deprived of the <hi>Whole</hi> Profits of the Land, who had Neglected to Pay <hi>The Lord</hi> His <hi>Tenth</hi> Part.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But after their Return from the <hi>Captivity,</hi> they fell again into a new Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Paying their <hi>Tythe;</hi> for which an Heavier <hi>Curſe</hi> fell upon them than before. A viſe Proſtitution of their <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and Greater Corruption in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> than ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, as appears in the Hiſtory of the

                  <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and afterwards to the time of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> when they were totally ſubjected to the <hi>Romans;</hi> at whoſe Pleaſure their <hi>Priesthood</hi> was Changed, made <hi>Annual</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary;</hi> and their whole <hi>Service</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Precarious.</hi> By their <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Corban,</hi> and ſuch like, they had made the <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>God</hi> of <hi>None Effect,</hi> as our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended them: Their <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> were <hi>Hypocrites, blind Guides, Serpents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. xxiij.</note> and a <hi>Generation of Vipers.</hi> Their <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> took Council againſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Miſtook and Murder'd their <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This was the Heavieſt of <hi>Curſes!</hi> They entail'd the Guilt of His <hi>Blood</hi> upon them and their Children; which lies upon them to this Day, in a <hi>Diſperſion</hi> to the four Winds, of now near 1700 years ſtanding; a much Greater Judgment (if they would Reflect upon it) than their 70 years <hi>Captivity</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> for their former <hi>Idolatries</hi> and <hi>Praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, as to our Preſent Subject, was ther any thing Remarkable as to the Non-Payment of their <hi>Tythes,</hi> before

               <p n="1">1. But ther is a Preference given, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 10. to that <hi>Charity</hi> which is Extended to <hi>The Houſhold of Faith,</hi> that is, to our <hi>Fellow-Chriſtians</hi> rather than others: <hi>Chriſt</hi> reckons it as done to Himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. 40.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſon of this carries it likewiſe; to Prefer the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>True Church</hi> before <hi>Sectaries:</hi> Yet ſo as not to Neglect even <hi>Sectaries, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Infidels:</hi> For all that are in <hi>Want,</hi> are Objects of our <hi>Charity,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad:</hi> All muſt be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: And while God grants to the moſt <hi>Wicked</hi> Perſon, <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> we ought to Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63938:112"/>towards it, by Preſerving that <hi>Life</hi> which <hi>God</hi> continues to them.

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. That this <hi>Charity</hi> muſt, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, be a <hi>Tenth,</hi> and not under, I do not Contend. For tho the <hi>Jews</hi> did pay a <hi>Second Tythe</hi> to the <hi>Poor;</hi> yet that ſtands not upon the ſame Foundation as the <hi>Tythes</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which were before the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="2">II. And as under the <hi>Law</hi> a <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> of the <hi>First-fruits</hi> was to be brought to the <hi>Altar,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Heathen</hi> were ſenſible of this.

               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Poor-Rates</hi> in <hi>England</hi> come now (as I am Inform'd) to about a <hi>Million</hi> in the Year.

               </p>
               <p>What Benefit has the <hi>Farmer</hi> for the <hi>Tythes</hi> being taken from the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy?</hi> Do the <hi>People</hi> then pay no more <hi>Tythe?</hi> That wou'd be an Eaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!

               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Let me Add, that it wou'd be more for the Advantage of the <hi>Crown.</hi> And conſequently of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It is well known, That theſe <hi>Lands</hi> pay'd More, in all Publick <hi>Taxes</hi> while they were in the hands of the <hi>Church,</hi> than they have done Since<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the <hi>Convocations</hi> always <hi>Tax'd</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Money</hi> is the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And the <hi>Circulation</hi> of it Diffuſes <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> to Every Part.

God requires Nothing but for our Good. And his folly is wiſer than Men.</p>
               <p>Let me laſtly Obviate a <hi>Prejudice</hi> I fore-ſee may be taken againſt my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal:</hi> For <hi>Prejudices</hi> muſt be Anſwer'd as well as <hi>Arguments;</hi> and often <hi>Sway</hi> Men More.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:63938:128"/>
               <p>It may be thought by ſome who have no Good-will to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> That this wou'd make the <hi>Clergy</hi> too <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Rich.</hi> And they bear no thought with more <hi>Indignation</hi> than this. They had rather the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſhou'd Periſh, than be Sav'd by the <hi>Church.</hi> It is not to Gratifie ſuch Men as theſe; But to ſatisfie others, and Guard them againſt their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that I offer the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the <hi>Number</hi> of our <hi>Clergy</hi> is too <hi>Few.</hi> They are not able to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch vaſt Charges as they ought. Eſpecially in <hi>London</hi> and other Great <hi>Towns,</hi> where it is impoſſible for ſome <hi>Miniſters,</hi> if they ſhou'd do nothing elſe, to <hi>Viſit</hi> all the <hi>Families,</hi> Much leſs every particular <hi>Perſon</hi> who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Cure;</hi> and the like in Many <hi>Country Pariſhes.</hi> This is one Great Cauſe of the Encreaſe of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> amongſt us, of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>Then our <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> are too Large. And the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Inſpection wou'd be Much more Effectual, if he had no More <hi>Prieſts</hi> under him than he cou'd be <hi>Perſonally</hi> Acquainted with, both as
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63938:128"/>to their <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe <hi>Defects</hi> cannot, As things now ſtand, be Amended, while ther are, as I am inform'd, above 2000 <hi>Pariſhes</hi> in <hi>England</hi> not worth above <hi>Twenty</hi> Pounds a Year. And Many not worth <hi>Ten.</hi> This makes <hi>Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> Neceſſary. And Reduces the Poor <hi>Clergy</hi> to ſuch <hi>Contempt,</hi> as to Render their <hi>Labours</hi> Wholly <hi>Ineffectual,</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to thoſe very <hi>Few,</hi> who can Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh their <hi>Character</hi> from their <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</hi> And withal betrays them Unavoidably to ſuch <hi>Ignorance,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Neither <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>Study,</hi> nor <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> to Buy a Book, unleſs a <hi>Dutch Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem;</hi> Nor opportunity for Good <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;</hi> That Nothing Leſs than the Power of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> had, can Reconcile <hi>Reſpect</hi> to them, or <hi>Authority</hi> to their <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> are ſo Stript, that except 5 or 6, ther muſt be the Greateſt Husbandry in the world to make our <hi>Biſhops</hi> Live in any ſort Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their <hi>Character;</hi> beſides Leaving their <hi>Children</hi> to the <hi>Pariſh</hi> when they Dye.</p>

               <p>But if the <hi>Church</hi> were Reſtor'd to her Right, then might ther be 20 times as many <hi>Clergy</hi> as we have: And their <hi>Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides that if the <hi>Poor</hi> were laid upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as we have been ſpeaking, it wou'd take ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they wou'd have much to ſpare; before the Number of the <hi>Poor</hi> wou'd be ſo Leſſen'd, by the Methods before Mention'd, as to Allow them to Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Number of the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ther were in the ſmall Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at one time, 38000 <hi>Levites</hi> above the Age of 30. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> xxiij. 3. <hi>England</hi> wou'd Require Many More, to Perform their <hi>Function</hi> as they ought, to the Profit of the People, And all the <hi>Patrimony</hi> that ever the <hi>Church</hi> had in <hi>England</hi> wou'd not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do it, to be Divided among ſo Many as wou'd be needful of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and for Maintaining the <hi>Poor</hi> beſides; together with the <hi>Building</hi> and <hi>Repairs</hi> of <hi>Churches, Schools, Colleges, Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and many other <hi>Charges</hi> profitable to the Nation.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:63938:129"/>
               <p>Add another Conſideration. If ther were ſuch a <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> ther wou'd be More Proviſion for Many of our <hi>Sons,</hi> whom we cannot Now Diſpoſe of, at leaſt not ſo well. And ther wou'd not be Danger of weakning the <hi>Strength</hi> or <hi>Wealth</hi> of the Nation, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> by ſo Many Idle <hi>Monks,</hi> as live upon the <hi>Labours</hi> of others, and Contribute Nothing to the Support of the <hi>Government.</hi> That Objection cannot Lie againſt <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergy,</hi> and where ther are None other. None that are Lock'd up from the World, and Muſt be Maintained only to <hi>Think.</hi> None but who are <hi>Labourers</hi> in the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and therefor Worthy of their <hi>Hire.</hi> And whoſe <hi>Hire</hi> go's not into a Bed of <hi>Sand,</hi> like what is given to the <hi>Regulars,</hi> and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returns: But it <hi>Circulates,</hi> like any other Money of the Nation, and do's as much Good.</p>
               <p>And our <hi>Clergy</hi> are, or may be, as Uſeful as any others in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in <hi>Council,</hi> and other Great Affairs of the Nation. And thoſe of Lower Rank, as <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for the Diſtribution of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:63938:130"/>
               <p>It is a <hi>Monkiſh</hi> humour (though ſome know it not) to think that the <hi>Clergy</hi> ought not to Intermeddle in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Affairs, or Live out of <hi>Cells.</hi> Thoſe who Converſe in the World, and Mind their <hi>Cures,</hi> are in the Rode certainly of doing Moſt Good. Theſe are therefor call'd the <hi>Secular Clergy,</hi> becauſe they Live in the World, and uſe Human Converſation. But thoſe who Run themſelves into <hi>Holes,</hi> as if (forſooth!) their <hi>Sanctity</hi> cou'd not bear the Common Air: And put themſelves under <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Models</hi> of their own Diviſing, do therefor give themſelves the Name of <hi>Regulars.</hi> And wou'd be <hi>Angels</hi> before their Time. But Men are Born into the World, to ſerve their Generation. And they who make too much Haſt out of it, either by taking away their own <hi>Lives</hi> (as ſome have done out of <hi>Conſcience</hi>) or by Making them Uſeleſs to the World in <hi>Retirement,</hi> are Guilty of the Same <hi>Sin,</hi> in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees.</p>
               <p>And the Example of <hi>Elijah,</hi> who was <hi>Perſecuted</hi> into a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> to ſave his Life, is a very impertinent
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63938:130"/>Precedent for them. For he was ſo far from Chooſing it, that he thought it an <hi>Affliction</hi> beyond <hi>Death;</hi>

               <p>As little will the Caſe of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Avail them. For his being in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> was in order to his <hi>Shewing</hi> or coming <hi>Publickly</hi> abroad unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And they who <hi>Retire</hi> for a time, in order to that End, are far from their Predicament, who put themſelves under <hi>Vows</hi> of <hi>Abſtraction</hi> for their Whole <hi>Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They may as well Urge the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who was forty days in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> But it is Happy, That they have not the leaſt Umbrage in the favour of <hi>Monkery</hi> through the Whole Life of our Bleſſed <hi>Lord.</hi> He came <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>

               <p>And when we ſay to God, <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy Name,</hi> if we Muſt Mean, All that is <hi>Hallowed</hi> to his <hi>Name,</hi> as well <hi>Things</hi> as <hi>Words,</hi> that All ſuch be Pay'd to Him, then whenever we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat <hi>The Lord's Prayer,</hi> we do Again <hi>Hallow</hi> All our <hi>Dedicated</hi> things to <hi>God.</hi> It is a Freſh <hi>Vow,</hi> at leaſt, an <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> and <hi>Recognition</hi> of all our Former <hi>Vows:</hi> And not only of <hi>Our Own,</hi> but of what has been <hi>Vowed</hi> and <hi>Dedicated</hi> by <hi>Others;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if we are their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> for then the <hi>Obligation</hi> Deſcends upon Us, and we are Anſwerable for the <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi>
